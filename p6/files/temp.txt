push the return address
push the control link
set the FP
push space for local variables

Here's the code you need to generate:
  # (1) push return addr
    sw	 $ra, 0($sp)
    subu $sp, $sp, 4
  # (2) push control link
    sw   $fp, 0($sp)
    subu $sp, $sp, 4
  # (3) set the FP
  # note: the following sets the FP to point to the "bottom"
  #       of the new AR; the reason for "+ 8" is:
  #       4 bytes each for the control link and the return addr
    addu $fp, $sp, <size of params in bytes + 8>
  # (4) push space for locals
    subu $sp, $sp, <size of locals in bytes>
